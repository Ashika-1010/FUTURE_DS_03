# 📊 Marketing Funnel & Conversion Performance Analysis

## 🚀 Project Overview

In this project, I analyzed a real-world marketing campaign dataset to understand how customers move through the sales funnel — from being contacted to becoming successful conversions.

The objective was to identify:

- Where drop-offs occur in the funnel
- Which contact methods perform better
- How previous campaign outcomes influence success
- Which customer segments convert more
- How campaign intensity impacts performance

This analysis reflects real-world marketing and growth analytics work.
